                <h2 className='artx-type-ths artx-gradient-text amt-18'>Summary</h2>
                <p className='artx-type-twf text-white font-weight-bold mt-3'>This is the first decentralized art creation and auction project on the Ethereum blockchain, in which a DArt, Genesis, is created and auctioned simultaneously.</p>
                <ul className='artx-type-twf text-white mt-3'>
                    <li className='artx-type-twf text-white'>A digital visual art will be created by ARTX AI using transaction data from the auction. The process will be entirely autonomous and conducted without human intervention.</li>
                    <li className='artx-type-twf text-white'>During the auction, people can purchase shares of the Genesis DArt and receive dividend income from the auction sale. Dividends are accumulated in real time as shares are bought and can be withdrawn at any time.</li>
                    <li className='artx-type-twf text-white'>Every purchase gives the player a chance to enter an appraisal of the auction’s final Hammer Price. When the auction ends, the 3 closest appraisers win the Appraisal Jackpot.</li>
                    <li className='artx-type-twf text-white'>At the end of the game, the Genesis DArt will be listed on ARTX, a decentralized art gallery and exchange.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 className='artx-type-ths artx-gradient-text mt-5'>Rules</h2>
                <ul className='artx-type-twf text-white mt-3'>
                    <li className='artx-type-twf text-white'>Each time a new share is purchased, all shareholders receive a portion of that sale (i.e. dividends) proportionate to the number of shares held.</li>
                    <li className='artx-type-twf text-white'>You can use your personal referral link to recruit other people to the auction. Both of you will receive 10%  of the referral’s purchase as bonus.</li>
                    <li className='artx-type-twf text-white'>The auction starts with a very high Hammer Price that decreases over time. The auction ends once the accumulated sales of Genesis shares reach or exceed the Hammer Price.</li>
                    <li className='artx-type-twf text-white'>Every share purchase freezes the Hammer Price decay for 60 seconds and increases the share price slightly.</li>
                    <li className='artx-type-twf text-white'>At the end of the auction, 90% of the Appraisal Jackpot is distributed among the first 3 closest appraisers proportionate to the number of shares bought when they enter their appraisals. 10% of the pot is distributed to the DArt community.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 className='artx-type-ths artx-gradient-text mt-5'>Auction Sale Allocation</h2>
                <p className='artx-type-twf text-white mt-3'>During the auction, each purchase has a different sale distribution between Dividends and Jackpot. The allocation to Dividends starts at 10% for the first Genesis share and will increase slightly overtime to a maximum of 70% as shares are bought. The allocation to Appraisal Jackpot moves in reverse from 70% to 10%. The remaining ETH is reserved for the referral bonus. If there’s no referral, the referral bonus will be distributed to all players as Dividends.</p>
                <h2 className='artx-type-ths artx-gradient-text mt-5'>Details (internal)</h2>
                <ul className='artx-type-twf text-white mt-3'>
                    <li className='artx-type-twf text-white'>All purchase and withdrawals are initiated by the players, so they pay for the gas. Dividends, bonus and jackpot will be credited to each player’s vault prior to withdrawal.</li>
                    <li className='artx-type-twf text-white'>Token price formula: TBD (see fomo3d)</li>
                    <li className='artx-type-twf text-white'>The cap decay is calculated as such:</li>
